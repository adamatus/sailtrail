# sailstats

A wind-sports focused activity tracker. Takes your GPS tracks from windpowered activities (sailing, kiting, windsurfing) and provides a wealth of information about the session.  Reports cover speeds (fastest 10s, fastest 500m, faster alpha-500m), upwind/downwind performance (polars, tack angles), and more!
