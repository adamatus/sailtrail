# sailtrail

A wind-sports focused activity tracker. Takes your GPS tracks from windpowered 
activities (sailing, kiting, windsurfing) and provides a wealth of information 
about the session.  Currently includes speed and polar plots.

Planned features include fastest 10s, fastest 500m, fastest
alpha-500, upwind/downwind performance, tack angles, and more!
